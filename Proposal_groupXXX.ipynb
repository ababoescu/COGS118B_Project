    "# Abstract \n",
    "The goal of our project is to create a classification, from our data, of the different music genres. What the data used represents are the different factors that contribute to music such as frequencies, durations, artist information, and different genres. The data we decided to utilize are measured using amplitude, frequencies, and Mel frequency. With this data, what we wish to accomplish is to perform dimensionality reduction. To do so,  we will perform exploratory data analysis and further clean it to be able to classify different genres. Success will be measured based on the classification of the genres of songs based on their characteristics and by utilizing statistical analysis to determine the correlation between the data points."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been ample amounts of research in the realm of music genre classification. This is in part because music is paramount in one’s culture and daily life. The music that one gets recommended on applications such as Spotfy/Pandora is classified using the different deep and machine learning approaches. In this manner, the greater “accuracy” for recommendations is best for the consumer because they will listen to music similar to what they already listen to <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1).\n",
    "Thus, the challenge for researchers is to understand what is the best model to use in order to classify the different genres. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and algorithms such as “Logistic Regression…[and] Random forest” have been utilized to extract the information from the Mel-frequencies. What Bahuleyan did at the University of Waterloo, Canada was take the data, sound waves and project them as spectrograms. In this manner, CNN can predict the genre of music. Subsequently, within their study, they depicted that there are two manners that can drive results in one manner over another. The transfer learning setting is essentially where the pre-trained weights are altered only in the manner of the feed-forward network. Additionally, the other setting is fine tuning the weights of the training process. Apart from these two settings, they also linked with the ideas of utilizing other machine learning applications. Yet, what was concluded was that between the two manners, there is no statistically significant difference in the genre classification of music. Subsequently, what they found as some of the best models for music genre classification problems was using the CNN approach or utilizing the XGBoost classifier <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). In this manner, the XGBoost is one of the preferred algorithms of machine learning because of its greater accuracy score over others such as random forest  <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). \n",
    "Furthermore, a similar approach has been conducted using the Free Music Archive dataset with different algorithms such as the CNN, Logistic Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Contrary to what most might believe, the ANN deep learning algorithm did not have the greatest score in terms of prediction accuracy. The CNN model, as aforementioned in the study above, actually proved to have the highest accuracy score of 88.54%. However, within their conclusion, the researchers determined that the CNN model is the best approach when working with spectrogram images; yet, ANN is “the best feature based classifier” <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). \n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we plan to analyze datasets based on musical characteristics and come up with an efficient music genre classification system. Our dataset(s) will include important attributes that compose music, such as frequencies, artist information, and duration. One (unsupervised) ML-relevant potential solution we have in mind is using the K-means and/or hierarchical algorithms for clustering. We also plan to utilize dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to make our datasets less complex and easier to analyze for clustering purposes and ultimately, classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make our problem quantifiable, we can incorporate certain metrics into our project like silhouette score, as well as cluster purity, both of which help us numerically evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms. To make our problem measurable, we can include a visual inspection/assessment of the clusters formed by our algorithms, as well as incorporate metrics like precision, recall (True Positivity rate), accuracy, and F1-score. Our team plans to perform multiple iterations of the task at hand, as well as document the entire development process. This would include preprocessing, model training, and analysis of the data, which allows for our ideas to be reproduced by other people. \n"

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the possible solutions that we have thought of is to manually go through each of the audio files to see if the music falls into the correct genres. The reason this solution could be applied to our project is because we are only going to be sampling a set number of audio files. However, there are many pitfalls with this proposed solution. One is that it takes ample time to go through each of the files. Hence, to combat this issue, each team member will evaluate a subset of the dataset and determine the accuracy. However, with this there is human error in the sense that each person has different ideas of what classifies a genre. \n",

    "In developing a music classification system, our team acknowledges the importance of addressing potential ethical concerns and privacy implications that may arise. We recognize the need to prioritize ethical considerations and safeguard user privacy throughout the development phases especially with our use of a dataset that relies on user behavior information. \n",
    "Ethical Considerations:\n",
    "Bias: One of the primary ethical concerns in ML-based recommendation systems is the potential for bias in the recommendations. Our team will strive to ensure that the system does not inadvertently reinforce or perpetuate biases related to race, gender, age, or other sensitive attributes. We will implement fairness-aware algorithms and regularly assess the system's performance across diverse user groups to mitigate any biases that may arise.\n",
    "Transparency: Users should have visibility into how the classification system operates and why certain classifications are made. We will prioritize transparency by documenting the algorithmic processes, providing explanations for recommendations, and enabling users to understand and control their preferences and data usage. \n",
    "User Consent: Respecting user autonomy and privacy preferences is paramount. We will incorporate mechanisms for obtaining informed consent from users regarding data collection, processing, and usage for personalized recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy Considerations: \n",
    "Data Security: Protecting sensitive user data is of utmost importance to us. We will adopt a data minimization approach, collecting only necessary data required for our classification system in order to safeguard user data throughout its lifecycle.\n",
    "Anonymity: Wherever possible, we will anonymize or de-identify user data to protect individual privacy while still enabling effective system performance. This includes using techniques such as differential privacy to prevent the re-identification of individuals from aggregated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team recognizes that despite proactive measures, unforeseen ethical dilemmas and privacy challenges may emerge once the system is in production. To address these issues, we will establish continuous monitoring, conduct regular ethical audits using tools like Deon (https://deon.drivendata.org), and remain responsive to emerging ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks.\n"
